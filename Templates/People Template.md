## Characteristics

> *Documenting traits helps us understand each other better, and learning preferences enables smoother communication. Keep these principles in mind:
>   - **Avoid fixed labels**: People grow and change over time. Outward behaviors don't reflect unchangeable truths
>   - **Respect differences**: The goal is better collaboration, not judgment
>   - **Begin with good intentions**: Draw inspiration from others' strengths and experiences to build cooperation and mutual understanding
> *Reference: OCEAN (Big Five) personality traits model*
